- Admin UI (depends on API Gateway)

### Critical Dependencies

The analysis reveals several critical dependency relationships:

**User Service** serves as the authentication foundation for the entire platform. All services requiring user context depend on this service for identity verification and user data retrieval.

**Currency Service** provides essential pricing data for asset valuation, cryptocurrency conversion, and multi-currency account management. Its availability directly impacts the accuracy of financial calculations across the platform.

**Notification Service** enables communication across all user-facing operations. While not blocking core functionality, its unavailability would significantly impact user experience and operational awareness.

**API Gateway** acts as the single point of entry, implementing cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. Its failure would render the entire platform inaccessible to external clients.

## 3. Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

The platform primarily uses **HTTP REST APIs** for synchronous communication between services. Each service exposes well-defined endpoints for:

- Health checks (`/health`)
- Service-specific operations
- Data retrieval and manipulation

### Asynchronous Communication

**Redis** serves as the message broker for asynchronous communication patterns, particularly for:

- Session management
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Real-time notifications
- Background job processing

### External Integrations

Several services integrate with external APIs:

**Currency Service** integrates with multiple pricing providers:
- Exchange rate APIs for fiat currency conversion
- Coinbase API for cryptocurrency pricing
- Metals APIs for precious metal pricing

**Crypto Service** integrates with Bitcoin infrastructure:
- Local Bitcoin node for blockchain operations
- External blockchain explorers for transaction verification

**Role-Based Access Control**: The User Service manages user roles and permissions, which are enforced at both the API Gateway and individual service levels.

### Data Protection

**Encryption at Rest**: All services use a shared master encryption key for sensitive data encryption in MongoDB.

**Encryption in Transit**: All inter-service communication occurs over the internal Docker network with TLS encryption planned for production deployment.

**Secrets Management**: Environment variables manage sensitive configuration data, with production deployment requiring proper secrets management integration.

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

**Redis Integration**: All services utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

**Cache Invalidation**: Services implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency across the platform.

### Database Optimization

**Service Isolation**: Each service maintains its own MongoDB database, preventing cross-service data coupling and enabling independent scaling.

**Connection Pooling**: Services implement connection pooling to optimize database resource utilization.

### Load Balancing

**Horizontal Scaling**: The Docker Compose configuration supports horizontal scaling of individual services based on load requirements.

**Health Checks**: All services implement health check endpoints enabling load balancer integration and automated failover.

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

### Health Monitoring

Each service implements comprehensive health checks covering:
- Database connectivity
- External API availability
- Service-specific functionality
