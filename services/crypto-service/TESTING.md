## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the SwiftPayMe Crypto Service. The purpose of this plan is to ensure the service is robust, secure, and functions correctly according to its specifications.

## 2. Testing Scope

The testing scope covers all aspects of the crypto service, including:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and modules.
- **Integration Tests**: Interactions between different components and services.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows and business processes.
- **Performance Tests**: Service performance under load.
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

## 3. Test Environments

- **Development**: Local development environment with mocked dependencies.
- **Testing**: Staging environment with a full deployment of the SwiftPayMe platform.
- **Production**: Production environment with real-world data and traffic.

## 4. Test Cases

### 4.1. Unit Tests

| Component | Test Case | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WalletService** | Create a new HD wallet | Wallet is created with a valid seed and address |
| **TransactionService** | Create a valid Bitcoin transaction | Transaction is created, signed, and broadcasted |
| **LightningService** | Create a Lightning invoice | Invoice is created with a valid payment request |
| **BitcoinService** | Get blockchain info | Returns correct blockchain information |

### 4.2. Integration Tests

| Scenario | Test Case | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Wallet Creation** | A new user registers and a wallet is created | A new crypto wallet is associated with the user ID |
| **Transaction & Balance Update** | A user sends a Bitcoin transaction | The transaction is processed and wallet balances are updated |
| **Lightning Payment** | A user pays a Lightning invoice | The payment is successful and the invoice is marked as paid |
| **API Gateway Integration** | API calls to the crypto service are successful | All API endpoints return the expected responses |

### 4.3. End-to-End Tests

| Workflow | Test Case | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Complete Bitcoin Transaction** | A user deposits fiat, buys Bitcoin, and sends it to an external wallet | The entire workflow is completed without errors |
| **Complete Lightning Payment** | A user creates a Lightning invoice and receives a payment | The invoice is paid and the user's balance is updated |
| **Wallet Recovery** | A user recovers their wallet using a seed phrase | The wallet is successfully restored with the correct balance |

### 4.4. Performance Tests

| Test | Metric | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Load Test** | Requests per second | > 500 RPS |
| **Transaction Throughput** | Transactions per minute | > 100 TPM |
| **Latency** | API response time | < 200ms (p95) |

### 4.5. Security Tests

| Test | Description | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Penetration Testing** | Attempt to exploit common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.) | No critical vulnerabilities found |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies | No high-risk vulnerabilities found |
| **Access Control** | Attempt to access resources without proper authentication | Access is denied |

## 5. Test Execution

- **Continuous Integration**: All tests are run automatically on every code commit.
- **Manual Testing**: End-to-end and exploratory testing is performed before each release.
- **Staging Deployment**: The platform is deployed to a staging environment for final validation.

## 6. Bug Triage

- **Critical**: Bugs that block major functionality or pose a security risk.
- **High**: Bugs that affect core features but have a workaround.
- **Medium**: Bugs that affect non-critical features.
- **Low**: Minor UI or cosmetic issues.

## 7. Conclusion

This comprehensive test plan ensures the SwiftPayMe Crypto Service is a reliable, secure, and high-performance microservice. By following this plan, we can confidently deploy the service to a production environment and provide a seamless experience for our users.
